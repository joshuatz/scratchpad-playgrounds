# scratchpad-playgrounds
Collection of prebuilt workspaces so you can *quickly* try out different languages and frameworks!

For right now, these will mostly be links to online pre-configured sandboxes, like *repl.it*, *Glitch*, etc.

I wanted to put this together because of the number of times when I've needed a temporary workspace just to test an idea or reproduce an issue from StackOverflow to help answer a question, and it has taken me longer than I would have liked to setup a test environment.

## Future thoughts:
In the future, I think it would be neat if this repo contained actual subdirectories with a scaffolding system. So you could clone the repo, and then to scaffold a playground / workspace for any given language framework, all you would have to do is either run a top-level CLI command, like `setup nodejs`, or navigate to the directory and run `npm run init`. Something like that. Might require a lot of scripting for advanced workspaces, like a WordPress env for theme testing.
